# OurTanks

The game is based on the mini-game "Tanks!" from the game Wii Play. We would like to adopt most of the original ideas, but as a version for the PC. The idea is to defeat increasingly difficult levels in a team of 1 - 4 players, or play a free-4-all match against other human players. Each player controls a tank that can
* move,
* rotate,
* fire bullets and 
* plant bombs.

The levels also contain enemy tanks, which are not necessarily equally strong. For example, some tanks can't move, or on the other hand have faster bullets. Additionaly, the levels contain walls and holes that block bullets and/or tanks and prevent a clear shooting path.

The programming complexity comes from a few different aspects: Of course, there is the basic functionality, but more difficult, in our opinion, is the intelligence of the enemies. They have to move smartly, dodge bullets and aim at the player. Also, they should avoid shooting down their own colleagues.
Depending on how fast we progress, we would also like to implement a level/campaign editor. With this, players can then build their own levels, group them into worlds (campaigns) and play/share the worlds with friends.
